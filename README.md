## Overview

Welcome to the Sensors App, a simple Android application that demonstrates how to access and utilize various sensors on an Android device. This app is designed for developers and enthusiasts who want to explore and experiment with sensor data.

### Features

- Display real-time data from the light and proximity sensors in lux and centimeters, respectively.
- Displays a list of all sensors on the user's device.
- Monitor sensor accuracy to ensure data reliability.
- Provides a clean and intuitive user interface for easy data visualization.
- A simple example of sensor data utilization in an Android application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Android Studio installed.
- An Android device or emulator with the necessary sensors (light and proximity).
- Basic knowledge of Android app development and Kotlin programming.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChristophyBarth/Sensors.git

2. Open the project in Android Studio. 

3. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device.

2. The app will display real-time sensor data from the light and proximity sensors.

3. Observe the values in lux for the light sensor and centimeters for the proximity sensor.

4. The app will also indicate the accuracy of the sensor data.

5. Experiment with different lighting conditions or objects near the proximity sensor to see how the values change.

6. Use this app as a reference or starting point for your own sensor-related projects.
